# BRA_Fiscal_modules_data: Clean Módulos Fiscais data in Brazil

This repository download and cleans _Módulos Fiscais_ in Brazil. The main source of the data is from IMAFLORA (https://www.imaflora.org/biblioteca?page=1&pesquisa=m%C3%B3dulo+fiscal). 

As the data did not contain Municipality codes, this was fuzzy matched using a municipality dataset. 

Later on, another source with fiscal modules and municipality codes was discovered. Comparing the files revealed a few municipalities missing in one or the other source. 
The final output contains the merged version, and is hence very exhaustive.
